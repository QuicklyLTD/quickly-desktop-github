Implement contract-first approach where both Angular and Electron processes share type definitions for all inter-process messages.\n\n**Rationale:** IPC communication in Electron apps is typically strung-typed and error-prone. Type-safe IPC prevents runtime errors, improves developer experience with autocomplete, and serves as living documentation of the communication contract between processes.",
